##Release 7: Reflect

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
 * I went in feeling like I hadn't had enough practice using GitHub in general.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
 * Using Git/GitHub to push, pull, create pull requests, merge, etc. became a bit easier with practice, but I feel like I have a lot of new questions after doing the assignment.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the 
guide?
 * It seemed like my pair and I were more or less on the same page. The assignment took us about 4-4.5 hours to complete. We only had the guide with us for an hour and mostly ran into trouble after the guide had left. We had to research how to use fetch/merge. Then, we had trouble creating a merge conflict. It seemed like GitHub was just overwriting the line that was different rather than reporting a merge conflict. We had to try 3 or 4 times before it finally worked. We're still not sure why it eventually worked the last time, but not on previous attempts.

* What still confuses you about Git?
 * My pair and I shared a repository and listed each other as collaborators, but for some reason, any feature branches that we pushed from our respective local repositories only showed up on my pair's GitHub repository, not on mine. Also, we were not able to figure out why we didn't get a merge conflict the first 2-3 times we tried. 

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
 * It was useful to work through the challenges with my pair, but I wish we had had the guide with us for a bit longer. I feel like my pair and I spent quite a bit of time re-doing parts of the assignment and although we eventually got the result we needed (mostly) we still weren't sure at the end why we were having so much trouble with the collaboration features and the lack of merge conflicts.
